You aren't? No worries, this simple blackjack terminal application is ideal for having your feet wet if you have never been playing blackjack before.

Now, before you start playing the game, just know that the following app is a simplified version of professional blackjack games; in fact, the computer is always going to be the dealer. The GUI (Graphical User Interface) is also quite simple since it's run on a terminal.
